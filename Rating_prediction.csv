Clarifications/issue points:

1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.
2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.
3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.
4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.
5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)
6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.
7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.
8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.

Pros:

1. Configuration is best at this price level.
2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.
3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.
4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.
5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.
6. Display is average and gets the job done.
7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.
8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.
9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.

Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.

I’ll update this review after one month of usage.",4.3 out of 5

2,2.0,"I bought this laptop with 8gb of ram and 256GB SSD, and intel core i3 11th gen with integrated graphics.
This laptop is super fast as their is a SSD, you can add a HDD if you run out of storage.

This laptop is good for taking online classes and web surfing. This laptop is not for coding and programming.
The only thing that I did not like is 14' inch, which cannot be used for all the works. For example, for bussiness work you need to have a bigger display.
The laptop heats up enormously, I am suprised for the heating issues, though it has a intel i3 11th gen. Worst build quality, the material used is low and laptop sucks when we type on the keyboard

I will update my review after 6 months, after a close monitoring.
Thank you.",4.2 out of 5

Resolution is extremely poor when it comes to sharpness of alphabets, Numbers, charts, other internet text etc that it takes a toll on your eyes as if you had poor vision (you often feel as if the eyes can't focus on those alphabets). Not even a day and i wish to return this laptop but company policy doesn't permits so. Please don't put your money in this laptop and go for other better brands as Asus or Dell.",4.1 out of 5

8,8.0,"Ordered this based on immense research. Certainly one of the best options available in this price (~₹60K). I ordered 2, however the second one was defective, ordered a replacement again, got another defective product. Returned it, ordered a seperate model with 120Hz, received defective charger. Pissed me off. This issue arrised despite Amazon assuring me they will quality check my replacement product.

Anyway, the laptop itself, I've bought 2 of. 1 from Amazon and 1 offline from Lenovo (got it cheaper there too) and it's genuinely good. So if you're seeing the reviews to find whether this is a good laptop, YES. It is! I use it for Video Editing and Programming. Programming is tough with just 8GB RAM, I might upgrade that. But the CPU performance I get is great. Not a gamer, so can't speak for that. But Nvidia's 1650 has a fantastic reputation with games, so you need not worry.

Buy this laptop over the Legion, TUF and Nitro. It's better overall. As for this seller, make sure you're thoroughly checking your product in the return period. I've had issues more than twice.

16,16.0,"First of all, the product images in amazon are not totally accurate. The images show a black keyboard with white letters and no fingerprint reader within trackpad. Actual product has silver colored keys with grey letter and there is a fingerprint reader. Refer ASUS official website for correct pics.

Things I liked:
- Light weight
- Bootup and shutdown speeds are good.
- Fast fingerprint reader.
- Good loud speakers.
- Premium look.

Things that could have been better..
- Display (Viewing angles are not that great. And I observed blue tint. Not sure if this is good for long sessions. I will have to find out.
- Keyboard (You cant see the letters on the keys from certain angles or lighting conditions. You will have to lean forward to see the letters. A black keyboard with white letters would have been better)
- Camera (Not at all good or I can say useless. I will give 1 out of 5 ratings for Camera)
- Left and Right click buttons make cheap clicky sound.

Overall I am happy with the product. Giving 4 stars instead of 5, only for the bad camera.",3.9 out of 5
17,17.0,"I love it. The camera feels like 1 mp but the sound quality is truly out of the world. The processor is very fast. Laptop boots in 1 second. This is perfect for me. . The battery backup is okay. If it's on sleep mode consumes nothing almost. No battery is enough for me. I use my laptop 24*7 almost... So battery will always run out after 5-7 hours depending on what I use it for. Coming from desktop. Yes no battery is enough for me. Secondly, it's light and I love the fact that it comes with all the ports one needs.. So I do not need an an extra usb c or adaptor . There are a few things I will like to add
1. 256 gb is enough and it's expandable with another ssd or hdd slot (like a 512 ssd or a 1 tb hdd)
2 this is not a gaming laptop. So realistically it does better gaming than expected with it's given hardware (as a gamer I would always suggest a strong desktop for core gaming)
3 . The 256 gb is ample for me because my desktop has 2 tb space and I've an additional 2 tb hdd external hdd. So if domeone is thinking of buying this without any additional space. Do consider again.
4 . For me the original office 2019 , windows 10 , n free antivirus with ssd was more important than a graphis card .. So ultimately it boils down to what your needs are. Research n buy. I love it",4.2 out of 5

The size of laptop is hardly little more than the std 15.6inches screen laptop so no issue with the bulkiness but better screen area utilisation. Multiple window work is easily doable.
Screen is glare free and easy on eyes,
Battery life not an issue as you can adjust the refresh rate and brightness etc and enhance.

23,23.0,"this review after use of 5 days.
1. somebody has written that above 1TB external HD can't be used. I have used my 5TB HD for transfer of data. It is well connected and data transfer rate is good.
2. Office 360 is temporary. hence I installed my Microsoft office which works well.
3. Speed is little bit slow which u may not notice if single application has operated.
4. PC operates at 50 to 70 % of CPU and almost 80% of memory which make little worried to me.
5. I am also using it for delivering reports through service plus and meeting. Till yet no problems. Installed java for that.

finally, i can say as on date that for this price it is a good laptop. Keyboard is not Bluetooth and yes removable. screen has good clarity and not having good viewing angle. Speaker is pathetic but it is ok in room. Mic is fantastic. As compared to other chrome based, I prefer it, as I have to operate it for digital signature and service plus.",3.8 out of 5

25,25.0,"Update:
I don't know what's wrong with my below comment for Amazon to remove it. Not just comment, who are all given rating 3 and below has been removed. I am really feel agigated by the way negative comments are removed.
I am asking to amazon, is it fair to remove poor ratings and keep only higher ratings? Is this not a way of fooling people?

There is lot to say good about it. Primarily if you analyze thin laptop segment with powerful processor and a graphic card you might have spend near to lak. But this one is near half the price in that section. We definelty have to appreciate what MI brought to the market and other brands charging heavily. What they just did for mobiles ( like bringing 30k market price worth of mobile to 10k range without compromising the quality) . They did it for laptop as well. GOOD JOB xiomi.

Performance : As for as thin and light laptop segment this is new benchmark they set for others to follow. You don't see lag at all. So far so good. But need to update this section once after a month of use.

Portability: sometimes I feel the charger provided is same weight as laptop. I feel like a mobile phone on hand when I am holding it

But, there is lot ot say bad about it as well.

Input devices

Trackpad : very pathetic.when u touch it you feel like u touched a unfinished cement surface. It sticks and very hard to navigate around. Highly recommended to buy a seperate mouse to get better experience on this laptop.

Keyboard : though it looks good. It not smooth and feels more plastic. Need to be improvised

No inbuild camera: during the wfh days absence of camera is a huge drawback but there is webcam you need to buy separetely and use it as external device

Charger and display: there is nothing new to excite about except for less bezel. The design is same as like 10 years old laptop.

Overall design: though looks premium feels cheap.. But this is justifiable for the price we pay

Overall User experience: great on performance. But has to improved in many other aspects like input devices , material quality

Overall review : I recommend to buy if you don't think much about feel and want only make full utilization on processing and performance. Otherwise if you expect something premiuim feel this is not for you.",4.2 out of 5

42,42.0,"A ThinkPad is the kind of laptop you buy when you know you want quality, and you know what you're shopping for.
The TN panel is a downer, but then again, for 45k, you're getting build quality that rivals laptops that are priced even 4-5 times higher. If you can spare the budget, then get the IPS panel, no question about it.
I'm running Fedora 34 on it, and there's been no hint of slow performance at all. Keep in mind that the fingerprint reader here is from Elan Electronics, and they haven't released a linux driver for it, so it will be disabled, but that's Elan's fault more than Lenovo's, if you're planning on running Linux on this.

Coming to the keyboard, it's obviously built to the stellar standards of usual ThinkPad keyboards. You get the very best in typing experience on a laptop, far surpassing anything you'd get from any of the competition. But then again, since you're considering a ThinkPad, you knew that already. Build quality feels rock solid, and the machine's weight is balanced very well.
The speakers are average, but considering that I'm on my headphones for 90% of my time for work, this is a non-issue. You can hear it clearly if you're in an AC room, but if you're running your fans at full tilt, then the volume is going to be drowned out. But there's no distortion or tinning in the high end, which is nice to hear.
Battery life on Fedora lasts me anywhere from 6-7 hours on a full charge, which is much better than I expected. Charging is also very quick, getting me to full charge in about 1 hour 20 minutes when it's off.

Finally, if you've read this far, then you know what you're wanting. Get the ThinkPad if you want a dependable workhorse and you won't be switching laptops for the next 20 years, the ThinkPad will easily last you that long.",3.8 out of 5

65,65.0,"A ThinkPad is the kind of laptop you buy when you know you want quality, and you know what you're shopping for.
The TN panel is a downer, but then again, for 45k, you're getting build quality that rivals laptops that are priced even 4-5 times higher. If you can spare the budget, then get the IPS panel, no question about it.
I'm running Fedora 34 on it, and there's been no hint of slow performance at all. Keep in mind that the fingerprint reader here is from Elan Electronics, and they haven't released a linux driver for it, so it will be disabled, but that's Elan's fault more than Lenovo's, if you're planning on running Linux on this.

Coming to the keyboard, it's obviously built to the stellar standards of usual ThinkPad keyboards. You get the very best in typing experience on a laptop, far surpassing anything you'd get from any of the competition. But then again, since you're considering a ThinkPad, you knew that already. Build quality feels rock solid, and the machine's weight is balanced very well.
The speakers are average, but considering that I'm on my headphones for 90% of my time for work, this is a non-issue. You can hear it clearly if you're in an AC room, but if you're running your fans at full tilt, then the volume is going to be drowned out. But there's no distortion or tinning in the high end, which is nice to hear.
Battery life on Fedora lasts me anywhere from 6-7 hours on a full charge, which is much better than I expected. Charging is also very quick, getting me to full charge in about 1 hour 20 minutes when it's off.

Finally, if you've read this far, then you know what you're wanting. Get the ThinkPad if you want a dependable workhorse and you won't be switching laptops for the next 20 years, the ThinkPad will easily last you that long.",3.8 out of 5

Clarifications/issue points:

1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.
2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.
3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.
4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.
5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)
6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.
7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.
8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.

Pros:

1. Configuration is best at this price level.
2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.
3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.
4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.
5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.
6. Display is average and gets the job done.
7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.
8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.
9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.

Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.

The TN panel is a downer, but then again, for 45k, you're getting build quality that rivals laptops that are priced even 4-5 times higher. If you can spare the budget, then get the IPS panel, no question about it.
I'm running Fedora 34 on it, and there's been no hint of slow performance at all. Keep in mind that the fingerprint reader here is from Elan Electronics, and they haven't released a linux driver for it, so it will be disabled, but that's Elan's fault more than Lenovo's, if you're planning on running Linux on this.

Coming to the keyboard, it's obviously built to the stellar standards of usual ThinkPad keyboards. You get the very best in typing experience on a laptop, far surpassing anything you'd get from any of the competition. But then again, since you're considering a ThinkPad, you knew that already. Build quality feels rock solid, and the machine's weight is balanced very well.
The speakers are average, but considering that I'm on my headphones for 90% of my time for work, this is a non-issue. You can hear it clearly if you're in an AC room, but if you're running your fans at full tilt, then the volume is going to be drowned out. But there's no distortion or tinning in the high end, which is nice to hear.
Battery life on Fedora lasts me anywhere from 6-7 hours on a full charge, which is much better than I expected. Charging is also very quick, getting me to full charge in about 1 hour 20 minutes when it's off.

Clarifications/issue points:

1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.
2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.
3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.
4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.
5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)
6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.
7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.
8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.

Pros:

1. Configuration is best at this price level.
2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.
3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.
4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.
5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.
6. Display is average and gets the job done.
7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.
8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.
9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.

7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.
8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.

Pros:

1. Configuration is best at this price level.
2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.
3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.
4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.
5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.
6. Display is average and gets the job done.
7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.
8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.
9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.

Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.

203,203.0,"A ThinkPad is the kind of laptop you buy when you know you want quality, and you know what you're shopping for.
The TN panel is a downer, but then again, for 45k, you're getting build quality that rivals laptops that are priced even 4-5 times higher. If you can spare the budget, then get the IPS panel, no question about it.
I'm running Fedora 34 on it, and there's been no hint of slow performance at all. Keep in mind that the fingerprint reader here is from Elan Electronics, and they haven't released a linux driver for it, so it will be disabled, but that's Elan's fault more than Lenovo's, if you're planning on running Linux on this.

Coming to the keyboard, it's obviously built to the stellar standards of usual ThinkPad keyboards. You get the very best in typing experience on a laptop, far surpassing anything you'd get from any of the competition. But then again, since you're considering a ThinkPad, you knew that already. Build quality feels rock solid, and the machine's weight is balanced very well.
The speakers are average, but considering that I'm on my headphones for 90% of my time for work, this is a non-issue. You can hear it clearly if you're in an AC room, but if you're running your fans at full tilt, then the volume is going to be drowned out. But there's no distortion or tinning in the high end, which is nice to hear.
Battery life on Fedora lasts me anywhere from 6-7 hours on a full charge, which is much better than I expected. Charging is also very quick, getting me to full charge in about 1 hour 20 minutes when it's off.

Finally, if you've read this far, then you know what you're wanting. Get the ThinkPad if you want a dependable workhorse and you won't be switching laptops for the next 20 years, the ThinkPad will easily last you that long.",3.8 out of 5

Clarifications/issue points:

1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.
2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.
3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.
4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.
5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)
6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.
7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.
8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.

Pros:

1. Configuration is best at this price level.
2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.
3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.
4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.
5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.
6. Display is average and gets the job done.
7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.
8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.
9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.

Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.

272,272.0,"A ThinkPad is the kind of laptop you buy when you know you want quality, and you know what you're shopping for.
The TN panel is a downer, but then again, for 45k, you're getting build quality that rivals laptops that are priced even 4-5 times higher. If you can spare the budget, then get the IPS panel, no question about it.
I'm running Fedora 34 on it, and there's been no hint of slow performance at all. Keep in mind that the fingerprint reader here is from Elan Electronics, and they haven't released a linux driver for it, so it will be disabled, but that's Elan's fault more than Lenovo's, if you're planning on running Linux on this.

Coming to the keyboard, it's obviously built to the stellar standards of usual ThinkPad keyboards. You get the very best in typing experience on a laptop, far surpassing anything you'd get from any of the competition. But then again, since you're considering a ThinkPad, you knew that already. Build quality feels rock solid, and the machine's weight is balanced very well.
The speakers are average, but considering that I'm on my headphones for 90% of my time for work, this is a non-issue. You can hear it clearly if you're in an AC room, but if you're running your fans at full tilt, then the volume is going to be drowned out. But there's no distortion or tinning in the high end, which is nice to hear.
Battery life on Fedora lasts me anywhere from 6-7 hours on a full charge, which is much better than I expected. Charging is also very quick, getting me to full charge in about 1 hour 20 minutes when it's off.

Finally, if you've read this far, then you know what you're wanting. Get the ThinkPad if you want a dependable workhorse and you won't be switching laptops for the next 20 years, the ThinkPad will easily last you that long.",3.8 out of 5

I have replaced 4 Surface Pro and in March-20, the device again started with flickering issue. Please note that as on today (06Aug20), the device is not yet replaced even though the company claims replacement in 7 days. It is a nightmare when you are using it as a primary device.

As mentioned earlier about the device replacement, note that when it comes to customer service, it is worst in India. the toll free number as usual never connects & if you chat, agents are sitting out of India and they don't know anything about service centers in India. The service center does not offer any help at all.

Please do not waste money in this device. You may check out via normal google search about the issues with Surface devices. There will hardly be any positive comment.",3.9 out of 5

Clarifications/issue points:

1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.
2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.
3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.
4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.
5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)
6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.
7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.
8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.

Pros:

1. Configuration is best at this price level.
2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.
3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.
4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.
5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.
6. Display is average and gets the job done.
7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.
8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.
9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.

Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.

The TN panel is a downer, but then again, for 45k, you're getting build quality that rivals laptops that are priced even 4-5 times higher. If you can spare the budget, then get the IPS panel, no question about it.
I'm running Fedora 34 on it, and there's been no hint of slow performance at all. Keep in mind that the fingerprint reader here is from Elan Electronics, and they haven't released a linux driver for it, so it will be disabled, but that's Elan's fault more than Lenovo's, if you're planning on running Linux on this.

Coming to the keyboard, it's obviously built to the stellar standards of usual ThinkPad keyboards. You get the very best in typing experience on a laptop, far surpassing anything you'd get from any of the competition. But then again, since you're considering a ThinkPad, you knew that already. Build quality feels rock solid, and the machine's weight is balanced very well.
The speakers are average, but considering that I'm on my headphones for 90% of my time for work, this is a non-issue.

But there's no distortion or tinning in the high end, which is nice to hear.
Battery life on Fedora lasts me anywhere from 6-7 hours on a full charge, which is much better than I expected. Charging is also very quick, getting me to full charge in about 1 hour 20 minutes when it's off.

Finally, if you've read this far, then you know what you're wanting. Get the ThinkPad if you want a dependable workhorse and you won't be switching laptops for the next 20 years, the ThinkPad will easily last you that long.",3.8 out of 5

394,394.0,"Received this yesterday (04/03/2021). Prompt delivery by Amazon (as expected).

Clarifications/issue points:

1. It’s a plastic body and not aluminium.
2. Hinges do not lift the lower part of the laptop.
3. Fan noise is there and it tends to get a bit hot.
4. There’s no special point on the edge of the lid to easily open it. You need to struggle a bit.
5. Battery life is descent with normal everyday usage (apprx- 5-6 hours)
6. Quality of adapter is not that good and the pin connector is not that good in terms of quality. You have to be cautious.
7. Body is prone to scratches and if you buy silver colour, then they will be visible easily. So be cautious in that area as well.
8. The packaging quality seemed to be very low. It was all dusty. I had to clean a lot. Laptop also got some dust on it’s body although it was packed well inside a plastic sheet.

Pros:

1. Configuration is best at this price level.
2. Performance is excellent in terms of multi-media usage and online tasks.
3. Data transfer from various storage devices is a very fast.
4. It’s light weight as it’s a plastic build. But the plastic quality seems to be really sturdy.
5. Sound quality is also good but not very good or excellent as boasted in the ads or online reviews.
6. Display is average and gets the job done.
7. Typing on the keyboard is really good and large keys give you a sense of good confidence.
8. You get 476 GB of available SSD memory which I suppose is good enough. Good point- it’s expandable upto 1 TB.
9. Microsoft integration is seamless and quick.

Overall, at this price budget (INR-62990), it’s a really well thought product by HP.

I’ll update this review after one month of usage.",4.3 out of 5

410,410.0,"A ThinkPad is the kind of laptop you buy when you know you want quality, and you know what you're shopping for.
The TN panel is a downer, but then again, for 45k, you're getting build quality that rivals laptops that are priced even 4-5 times higher. If you can spare the budget, then get the IPS panel, no question about it.
I'm running Fedora 34 on it, and there's been no hint of slow performance at all. Keep in mind that the fingerprint reader here is from Elan Electronics, and they haven't released a linux driver for it, so it will be disabled, but that's Elan's fault more than Lenovo's, if you're planning on running Linux on this.

Coming to the keyboard, it's obviously built to the stellar standards of usual ThinkPad keyboards. You get the very best in typing experience on a laptop, far surpassing anything you'd get from any of the competition. But then again, since you're considering a ThinkPad, you knew that already. Build quality feels rock solid, and the machine's weight is balanced very well.
The speakers are average, but considering that I'm on my headphones for 90% of my time for work, this is a non-issue. You can hear it clearly if you're in an AC room, but if you're running your fans at full tilt, then the volume is going to be drowned out.

441,24.0,"Pretty Happy. It has everything I wished for.

Upgrading from an S9 after 3 years.
A good camera, waterproofing, strong processor, high battery life and headphone jack 3.5mm were my basic requirements.

It has everything except the 3.5 mm jack. Compromised on that because I was getting rest.

I do not play games but WiFi for majority of hours, 99+ tabs on Firefox and Chrome, many vudeo callings on 4G network (Jio) and heavy PDF files are operating simultaneously on my phone. Along with occasional YT Video.
Earlier, S9's (Exynos 9810, 4GB RAM) never lagged on this routine and after 3 years, now it started to.

Initially, was considering the A52 as it also had all needs. It had the 3.5 mm jack in it, but the compromise there was the Camera and processor.

Went through the details of the Snapdragon processor on A52, and realized that procoessor is not even close to the flagship processor, received earlier on S9. (Exynos 9810). That was the deal breaker for me as A52 will not be even able to handle current requirements, let alone future ones. I think A52 has SD730G or 720G. S9 with Exynos 9810 is faster than that chipset. The A52 5G may or may not be launched and even that has 750G which is not equal to S9's old one. These are facts available online. After paying 30-35k for A52/A72, one is getting a processor that was not even equal to the 3 year old Samsung Flagship of S9 (9810).

People would be suprised to know that pairing 8GB or 12 GB RAM with low-mid/mid processors will give you *less* performance than having lesser RAM on Top End processors.

It is with this need, kade the decision to purchase S20 FE 5G. It has a better camera. and the Snapdragon 865 is future proof and will take care of my needs for 3 years comfortably without lags.

Other phone that was considered was Asus ROG 5, It has everything needed at nearly same price point. Mainly, the 6,000 Mah battery. There the compromise was on Camera and Waterproofing. Was also concerned about Asus after sales support. Samsung after sales support is best in India as I have witnessed it my self. People should also consider this. That how good the company is in After sales support.

5G was not a concern. Satisfied with 4G speeds and where heavy speeds are needed, prefer to use WiFi fiber based. Also, no phone currently sold in India is 5G proof, as it is not known which 5G bands will be brought to India by Government.

The Camera is great and have put a 512GB Sandisk Ultra Card inside.

This is the best phone available from Samsung right now and the definitely among the top 3 by any standards in the whole market. One cannot go wrong with this.

Charger
It has a 15W inside while phone supports 25W. Personally I am not bothered because 15W is good for battery life and health. Fast Charging reduces it. The difference is also small. Difference would be great if phone supported 65W and then we were given a 15W one. 15W will improve your battery life.

Never considered the OnePlus as it's a Chinese brand. I try to avoid Chinese one as much as possible. Also the S20 FE 5G is assembled in India in Noida, U.P. OP9 is full direct import, even the box. It has been 10 months since Galwan, but we must never forget

Edits

1) Display
Phone supports 120Hz. Looks Beautiful. But I do not use it. Battery difference is significant. Around 1-2 hours. 60Hz lasts longer. So...

2) Camera - I am happy. Photos look even better on laptop (after transfer) :D.

3) Battery Life
- takes 2 hours 13 minutes for full charge with 15W charger. Battery is 4,500 Mah. First 50-60% were very fast. After that charge happens slowly
- lasts 1 and a half day with my normal use, which is heavy. (see above). 1st day ended with 36% :D
- Woke up next morning to find it at 27%.
- Lasted till around 3 p.m.
- Make your own conclusions

4) I do not play games. No comments on how battery is affected when we play games

5) What's in the Box?
- no silicone cover, no earphones
- charger you get is 15W. *It is Type C to Type C Charger* (You cannot use old chargers with normal USB port)
- SIM Tool

What I do not like/A bit surprised
- Phone is *Heavy*
- If you are those who like to read/browse on phone for extended hours (I use Kindle often), you will feel real strain within 15 minutes. (At least I do) Maybe, because last phone was very light. Hopefully, arms adjust soon.

This comparison is not meant to denigrate A52/A72's processors. They just do not fit the use pattern

Do not buy 3rd party Type C to 3.5mm jacks available on Amazon. From Samsung Shop, purchased the original Samsung supported jack available for 699. Good 3rd party ones on Amazon are selling fro 999/899. Their compatibility is suspect. Jacks are beneficial over Bluetooth based ones because jacks reduce the battery charge. Using 3.5mm jack easily saves 10-12% over 2-3 hours.

I have not experienced luckily any heating till now from phone.

Edit 2 - Pics
- butterfly pics. Please Note, I am no professional photographer. But this butterfly pic is at very high zoom. It is taken from good distance. Could not go near it. I am happy with the camera's zoom capabilities.

Another thing I like about the headphones is the comfort they offer. I sometimes borrow the headphones from my children to take online classes. I have been amazed with the fact that even after keeping the headphones on for a few hours at a time, my ears do not hurt at all, something I have experienced previously with every pair of on-ear headphones.",4.4 out of 5

Here I'm sharing our experience with this product.

Build quality⏮️⏭️ Its build quality is Awesome and looks premium in hands when you hold it in your hands. Also its a light weight product.

Sound quality⏮️⏭️ sound quality is good.
Works well for soft and melody songs with my personal experience.

Length⏮️⏭️ comes with long size cable which is a cool thing and I like it.
One thing I like is that it comes with a strap to tangle the cable.

Ear comfort ⏮️⏭️ get fit easily in ears.

Durability ⏮️⏭️ It will depend what kind of user you are. If you're protective towards your stuff so maybe this will be a last long product.

******************************************

Cons⏯️⏯️

Come with dedicated microphone which works ok ok. There is still noise in calling while traveling. So not satisfied with this noise cancellation Mike.

I am not satisfied with the bass quality. It works average.

******************************************

What you will get inside?⏮️⏭️ You will get earphone with some paperwork's and it comes with one year warranty which you have to activate by calling on the given number I guess.

You will also get two pairs of additional ear protector for further use.

I hope this will help you to make your purchase decision.😊",4.1 out of 5

823,7.0,"NOTE:
@ There are thousands of reviews for this product, but surprisingly there's hardly any review explaining its performance in long run and comparing this earphones with similar ones available in market.
@ I am using these earphones since last one year and in the meantime I also happen to use JBL C100SI and Sennhesiers CX180, so I would be comparing all these 3 earphones in this review.
@ You get a "" L "" shaped connector in these earphones, so note that.

I am dividing this review in several subtopics directly stating my user experience and stating which is the Best earphone in that subtopic,

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
● boAt - Flat cables which is tangle free in true sense. Metal housing holds up good, but colour sheds off after 5-6 months. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
● JBL - Small round cables, shredding off after 7-8 months of moderate usage. Plastic housing doing great so far.
Connector is bent, but not in perfect ""L"" shape, so its quite pain to use while resting.
● Sennheiser - Small round cables, holding up good after 1 year of rough use. Plastic housing has become slick, as rubber coating on it has shredded off. Perfect ""L"" shaped connector which is apt for using with laptops while resting.
●● WINNER- boAt 225 ●●

COMFORT :
------------
● boAt - comfortable enough when used while in upright position. These are VERY UNCOMFORTABLE when you use them while resting on couch or bed for watching movies or so. Has very long earphone head.
● JBL - Comfortable enough in upright position. Slightly uncomfortable using while resting, as these have offset opening.
● Sennheisers - Comfortable in both the position. These are apt for long duration usage.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

LOUDNESS :
-------------
CX180 > boAt 225 > JBL CS100SI

● boAt - tends to distort above 75% level of volume.
● JBL - Crystal clear even at full volume, but has least sound level in all of three.
● Sennheisers - tends to distort above 75% level of volume, but has greater sound level of all.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY ( Bass, mids & lows ) :
---------------------------------------------
I noticed that all of them have almost same Mids & lows, which are strong & Crisp. But bass levels are different.
● boAt - has average bass, I am very disappointed with it, since these earphones are marketed as bassheads.
● JBL - has least bass of all, I felt treble is high in these.
● Sennheisers - ton of bass and when used proper eartips, its just a treat for bass lovers.
●● WINNER - sennheisers cx180 ●●

SOUND QUALITY OVER CALL :
----------------------------------
● boAt - I noticed in early few months, quality over call was great, but started to deplete after 5-6 months. But its still good, not as good as new. Noise cancellation is good and noticeable by person on other side.
● JBL - its quite average and has maintained the quality over a year now.
● Sennheisers - their NO microphone, lol :P
NOTE: boAt & JBL both's mics works with android and iOS perfectly.
●● WINNER - boAt 225 ●●

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
● boAt : 1 Year warranty. Had no issues till date, so didn't got chance to check it. But some of my friends who ran into issue had mixed experiences.
● JBL : 1 Year warranty. Had issue with one ear piece and was replaced within 2 weeks after contacting nearest service center.
● Sennheisers : 2 Years warranty. I had 2 of these and one pair stopped working after a year and half, was replaced immediately within a week after contacting nearest service center.
NOTE: I first contacted the company via mail with my product details and I was given all the required details for service. I would suggest this to all.
●● WINNER : sennheiser cx180 ●●

CONNECTIVITY :
------------------
All the earphones have 3.5mm connector and works perfectly with both android and iOS devices.

VERDICT :
----------
I don't think I need to explain anything else now, since I mentioned all the points of all these earphones. To sum up, I would say boAt 225 are good, if you are going to use the mic alot and not going to use these earphones while resting on couch for watching movies. If you want mic and even want to watch movies resting, then go for JBL CS100SI. But if you want the earphones only for watching the movies and listening to songs like me, then certainly go for Sennheisers cx180.

Hope this review helps you make sound decision.",4.1 out of 5
824,8.0,"It has great sound quality and bass but after (2 months) of use they got break without any falling or jerk. I was wearing it normally and it got break from one side.
I call to costumer care service no. but no reply is coming, I also filed a complaint in Boat official website for warranty claim but no respond is coming from there too. And there is no service center where I can approach for my claim.
So my ₹1499 are wasted now...",4.1 out of 5
825,9.0,"Pros:
1. Great sound quality
2. bass is outstanding
3. Far better than anything you can get for 999 rupees
4. Passive noise cancellation
5. Good battery life. Charged once in my one week
6. good quality body and mic compatible with all other headphones at 3000rs range
7. Great specs. & adjustable size

Cons:

2. The ear cushins are little bit uncomfortable for long time use. Just a bit
3. the packing is not good....
4. Cant be equivalent to 5000 rupee headphones....
5. Mrp 2000 is quite high for this. Check for offers before buying.... I bought for 999

Sound : 5/5

Pls note that bass is excellent . Don't go by negetive feedback. I also have boat earphone you can not find such difference between boat and this one-Honestly.
Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)
Battery : 4.5/5. Overall back up is excellent. But 4.5 because after giving warning it's last only 10 minutes. Other wise it's excellent.
Sweat proof , nice look, good connectivity.
Over all its a good deal @ 699/-
Guys go for it , if u r thinking of boat u will be happy to buy this. This will definitely satisfy ur requirement in terms of good sound and bass.",3.9 out of 5
829,13.0,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.,3.8 out of 5
830,14.0,"Highly recommended for beginner producers, the mids need to be a bit more enhanced but the thing we need to keep in mind is that these are Headphones worth INR1500 NOT INR15k. The product is covered under 2 years warranty which is a great thing.
If you really want to know how flat these headphones are I will highly suggest you to download ""Sonarwarks Reference 4"", It's a paid software but you get a 21days free trial without adding any card details.

*BONUS TIP*
Most of you must be wondering what kind of review is this? where is the usual pros & cons section?
Well, what works for me may not work for you, There is a debate in our industry since decades about the best budget headphones which you already searched or might search really soon, Some will suggest you about ATH M40x, Some will say Sony MDR 7506, Some people use ATH M50x for mixing (literally) and some say it has high bass, some say DT770 pro is great for mixing other say it has a V-shaped frequency.
""Flat"" headphones & speakers are just a MYTH, It's just BS, these are not my words, These are words of Bob Power (44 years of experience & still active in the studio, platinum producer. wanna know more? Google him) The real art is that you should know your headphones, A producer/mix engineer can produce GREAT mix on these headphones (or any low budget) compared to an amateur who has the world's best studio. I have seen many masterclasses and read tips by many people who just say one that that only thing that matters is ""your hearing"", If you can train your ear and then understand your headphone then you can make a great mix, Learn from the bottom before getting costly 10k headphones after reading someone else's review, YOU WILL REGRET LATER ON, Initially you will love the product (Because it's better than what you have been listening to, Obvious psychology) but your ear will develop around those headphones, according to their frequency. I am again repeating initially you will be like ""this is the best thing ever, everything is so clear, OMG OMG. I love them.""
Train your ear as much you can, As said above get 21days trial version of Sonarworks and listen to as much music, bypass it via software then listen to original headphone sound and you will just understand the difference and 21 days is enough time to understand any headphone if you are dedicated and passionate about learning music.

""World won't listen to your music on the same pair of headphones (be it any pair), you need to develop a certain taste and check the mix in multiple sources and it can be your laptop speaker, your cellphone, your TV, your car speaker you need to find a way where it sounds good everywhere, This is what mixing is all about of course including EQing and adding FX""

I also recommend reading ""Bobby Owsinski's book: A mixing Engineer's Handbook"" if you don't have any source to learn.

Good luck with your venture.
The video I am talking about Bob is on youtube, Search: Mixing Masterclass with Bob Power [MixCon 2017]
WATCH THE FULL VIDEO, You might not understand most of it (if you are a beginner and no knowledge about the DAW he's using) but your brain will absorb these things and will definitely help later on. First 15-20 minutes is a must watch.",4.1 out of 5

 Lots of request floating in @ What the WATT - Reviews for reviewing this entry level headphones from JBL. We got this headphones from a colleague and thought its time to post a detailed review after a week of constant usage.

We tried plenty of entry level cheap headphones, time and again realizing one thing - ""The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low prices are forgotten""

Summary of review

1. Specifications – Mic and 1-button remote
2. Reasons to buy
a. Great fit and multiple right sleeves for that perfect bass response
b. Amazing bass
3. Reasons not to buy
a. Many options available if one can up the budget by 100 Rupees by JBL and other brands

Detailed review

Packaging - The one startling thing you notice when receiving this product from amazon is what lies beneath that packaging of Amazon is a great package of JBL and JBL has not compromised on their values to provide great packaging and great sound. When you compare the same with Mi or boat its pretty evident that there is a significant compromise on the packaging in order to probably provide a good product, but the compromise in other product department is also clear when one starts discovering other aspects of say MI and boat (Rating 5/5)

Design/Comfort – When choice is of great sound - its also for great aesthetics, you probably don’t want to carry an awful product in your ear/body and only enjoy great music, isn’t it ! JBL does not disappoint in design even at this entry level wired headphone. The wire is long (sometimes feels too long) but after a use of 2-3 days we find it quite manageable. The twin cable is back but JBL has some special engineering design for this good old twin cable – “High fidelity twin cable” (rating 3.5/5)

Sound – In a nutshell the audio is crisp and loud. This time I believe JBL got the voice of customer and packed a great sound in great price. The beauty of these headphones is you don’t have to screw those in your ear. One of the sleeve will fit perfectly to an Indian ear and that matters for experiencing the bass properly, a bad fit will certainly be not delivering experience of good bass. The shape of the headphone tube/canal is rightly angled – honestly we have not seen such a good design, it’s a little way from typical JBL design but we welcome that change which reflects in sound positively. Low frequency – 5/5, Mid/High Frequency – 4.5/5 – Voice clarity – 4/5. Over all sound is a go from our side and we give these headphones 4.5/5 rating

Durability – We ran an exhaustive test on these headphones especially on the electrical joints/abused them and these held on to the connections really long. Infact lifted a 2KG load with the cables to test strength and they did not break at all – A specially designed test in our labs

Call quality - Noise cancellation microphone is indeed a treat to the ears while on call and a one button remote is certainly value for money at the price. We give it 5/5 for the microphone and call quality. Remote is of great usage, smart one button remote in same microphone housing - wonderful (Single press - Mute/start music, Double click - Next song)

Overall rating – If you are looking for a budget good sounding product and value the brand you get associated with – JBL C50HI is for you. We rate these 4/5 and not many entry level headphones get past 3.5 rating from our test lab and reviewers. So go for these headphones (pick any color from 3 available).

Used it for almost 3 months now - Updating rating to 5/5 - Amazing durability",3.9 out of 5
832,16.0,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.,3.8 out of 5

835,19.0,"Things I already knew:
- These are not bass centric
- Noise cancellation does not block all sounds, but blocks most.
Things I did not know:
- Sound distorts at max volume
- There’s a crackling noise every now and then
You can do a google search to see that they are known issues and many users are facing these. The above 2 points were unacceptable in a 30000/- bucks headphone. I got these for 20k during the sale but still unacceptable. It was so shocking to me that I went to a bose store to check a) if they are genuine or not b) to demo a pair to see if the issues exist in the demo as well. They were genuine and the same issues existed in the demo pair as well.
Thank you so much Amazon for the quick delivery and for processing the return. I would have been stuck with these if I would have bought them elsewhere. Anyone who has them and says these issues do not exist is either deaf or too proud to accept that he/she has been duped by bose.",4.4 out of 5

 Lots of request floating in @ What the WATT - Reviews for reviewing this entry level headphones from JBL. We got this headphones from a colleague and thought its time to post a detailed review after a week of constant usage.

We tried plenty of entry level cheap headphones, time and again realizing one thing - ""The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low prices are forgotten""

Summary of review

1. Specifications – Mic and 1-button remote
2. Reasons to buy
a. Great fit and multiple right sleeves for that perfect bass response
b. Amazing bass
3. Reasons not to buy
a. Many options available if one can up the budget by 100 Rupees by JBL and other brands

after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.

sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,

calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

839,23.0,"First, I was mainly purchasing these headphones for the wireless and battery features. What I received was a great quality sound, and greater battery life than stated.

Pros:
- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.

- Great Design – I fell in love with headphone, from the time I set my eyes on it. It is stunning looking and great design.

- Sound Quality - The old headphones I was replacing with these were kind of tinny in sound quality. These headphones have really rich deep bass. I was extremely pleased with the sound.

Overall, it checks all boxes for a stunning Headphone at a very affordable price. I am very satisfied with my purchase.",4.2 out of 5

857,41.0,"First of all Thank You Harman for launching an affordable headphone. Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.
If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.
Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.
The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.
The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.
I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.

Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.
Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.

861,45.0,"I ordered this product as i get on a lot of calls on my laptop and my phone and i wanted a headphone which can simultaneously connect with both. Now the headphone connects with both, and as advertised if i am listening to music and a call comes (on the same or the other device) the call gets priority, but here are the problems i am facing:

1. If i am listing to music on my laptop and my phone rings, i can't answer instantly, if i do, my mic will not work
2. if my headphone is connected to both my laptop and my phone and i am on a call on one device and i get a call on the other device, i can't switch easily. I face problems. the headphone switches off, or my mic doesn't work properly after switching.
3. if i am connected to both devices and not listening to music, my headphones will switch off after five to ten minutes if i don't get on a call. There are times when we are ideal, the device should remain on and connected but it doesn't happen.
4. if i switch on the headphone to take a call, the mic doesn't work properly (instantly), if i switch on, wait for fifteen to twenty seconds and then answer the likely hood of mic working properly is higher.

All these issues are in the first couple of days of operating. I am returning the device as i think over continued use the problems will only worsen and in another day i will not be eligible to return the device any longer.

Having listed all my problem, i would like to once again say, they are delivering on all the features they are promising in terms of sound quality, leather quality and battery life it's just that for me the device is not suitable for what i wanted to use it for.",3.9 out of 5

880,64.0,"First of all Thank You Harman for launching an affordable headphone. Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.
If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.
Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.
The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.
The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.
I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.

Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.
Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.

883,67.0,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

884,68.0,"I ordered this product as i get on a lot of calls on my laptop and my phone and i wanted a headphone which can simultaneously connect with both. Now the headphone connects with both, and as advertised if i am listening to music and a call comes (on the same or the other device) the call gets priority, but here are the problems i am facing:

1. If i am listing to music on my laptop and my phone rings, i can't answer instantly, if i do, my mic will not work
2. if my headphone is connected to both my laptop and my phone and i am on a call on one device and i get a call on the other device, i can't switch easily. I face problems. the headphone switches off, or my mic doesn't work properly after switching.
3. if i am connected to both devices and not listening to music, my headphones will switch off after five to ten minutes if i don't get on a call. There are times when we are ideal, the device should remain on and connected but it doesn't happen.
4. if i switch on the headphone to take a call, the mic doesn't work properly (instantly), if i switch on, wait for fifteen to twenty seconds and then answer the likely hood of mic working properly is higher.

All these issues are in the first couple of days of operating. I am returning the device as i think over continued use the problems will only worsen and in another day i will not be eligible to return the device any longer.

Having listed all my problem, i would like to once again say, they are delivering on all the features they are promising in terms of sound quality, leather quality and battery life it's just that for me the device is not suitable for what i wanted to use it for.",3.9 out of 5

894,78.0,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.,3.8 out of 5

My daughter loves the lights on the headphones, loves the headphones as she has the choice of using bluetooth or plugging in the headphones using her headphone jack. I also found the fact you can change the max sound output great as it limits the damage to your child's hearing as they cannot turn the volume up beyond a certain point.

One of the earbuds will stop working, after week the other earbud will also stop working. Now if you will try to claim the warranty than you will first find that they will say that they are going to reach you in 2 days but that will not happen. They will never reach to you, you will try to reach them using their customer care number but believe me they will never attend your call. Now how i am saying this i will tell you. In December 2020 i bought this product, after using it for one week i thought that it is a very good product and i suggested this product to my relative and after 2 weeks of use it stopped working and all that happened that i told you. Same happened to my relative. Its been around 1 month no one came for the replacement of the product. Now i will tell you how everyone is saying that this is a very good product. This is because almost everyone post their review under a week and all of them thought that it is a good product.

Pros:
- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.

931,115.0,"First, I was mainly purchasing these headphones for the wireless and battery features. What I received was a great quality sound, and greater battery life than stated.

Pros:
- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.

- Great Design – I fell in love with headphone, from the time I set my eyes on it. It is stunning looking and great design.

- Sound Quality - The old headphones I was replacing with these were kind of tinny in sound quality. These headphones have really rich deep bass. I was extremely pleased with the sound.

949,133.0,"First of all Thank You Harman for launching an affordable headphone. Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.
If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.
Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.
The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.
The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.
I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.

Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.
Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.

993,177.0,"First, I was mainly purchasing these headphones for the wireless and battery features. What I received was a great quality sound, and greater battery life than stated.

Pros:
- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.

- Great Design – I fell in love with headphone, from the time I set my eyes on it. It is stunning looking and great design.

- Sound Quality - The old headphones I was replacing with these were kind of tinny in sound quality. These headphones have really rich deep bass. I was extremely pleased with the sound.

Overall, it checks all boxes for a stunning Headphone at a very affordable price. I am very satisfied with my purchase.",4.2 out of 5

995,179.0,"First of all Thank You Harman for launching an affordable headphone. Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.
If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.
Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.
The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.
The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.
I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.

Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.
Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.

998,182.0,"Pls don't buy, i know you are going to see about all the comments positive, i am going to give the reason for that too. First of all, when you will buy the product, for the first 2 weeks it will work perfectly and you will think that the product is very good but after 2 weeks problems will start arising. One of the earbuds will stop working, after week the other earbud will also stop working. Now if you will try to claim the warranty than you will first find that they will say that they are going to reach you in 2 days but that will not happen. They will never reach to you, you will try to reach them using their customer care number but believe me they will never attend your call. Now how i am saying this i will tell you. In December 2020 i bought this product, after using it for one week i thought that it is a very good product and i suggested this product to my relative and after 2 weeks of use it stopped working and all that happened that i told you. Same happened to my relative. Its been around 1 month no one came for the replacement of the product. Now i will tell you how everyone is saying that this is a very good product. This is because almost everyone post their review under a week and all of them thought that it is a good product. I would recommend not to buy, instead collect 2 to 3 hundred rupees and go for a better company such as boat so that atleast if a problem arise they will resolve it. pls",3.5 out of 5

 In this headset if you are trying to record a video , you will found that recording volume is very low and highly dis satisfactory!

I am totally unhappy with this product.

Not only this when I tried to return this product Amazon said they will neither return or refund only replace with another headset of same type.

after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),

sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.

1041,225.0,"First of all Thank You Harman for launching an affordable headphone. Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.
If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.
Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.
The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.
The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.
I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.

Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.
Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.

1046,230.0,"First, I was mainly purchasing these headphones for the wireless and battery features. What I received was a great quality sound, and greater battery life than stated.

Pros:
- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.

- Great Design – I fell in love with headphone, from the time I set my eyes on it. It is stunning looking and great design.

1091,275.0,"I ordered this product as i get on a lot of calls on my laptop and my phone and i wanted a headphone which can simultaneously connect with both. Now the headphone connects with both, and as advertised if i am listening to music and a call comes (on the same or the other device) the call gets priority, but here are the problems i am facing:

1. If i am listing to music on my laptop and my phone rings, i can't answer instantly, if i do, my mic will not work
2. if my headphone is connected to both my laptop and my phone and i am on a call on one device and i get a call on the other device, i can't switch easily. I face problems. the headphone switches off, or my mic doesn't work properly after switching.
3. if i am connected to both devices and not listening to music, my headphones will switch off after five to ten minutes if i don't get on a call. There are times when we are ideal, the device should remain on and connected but it doesn't happen.
4. if i switch on the headphone to take a call, the mic doesn't work properly (instantly), if i switch on, wait for fifteen to twenty seconds and then answer the likely hood of mic working properly is higher.

All these issues are in the first couple of days of operating. I am returning the device as i think over continued use the problems will only worsen and in another day i will not be eligible to return the device any longer.

1103,287.0,"I received this 2 days (?) ago and I'd like to write down a few interesting (?) things about this product.

(1) I think this earbuds are reasonably priced & relatively comfort ones. The sounds quality is not super great but generally satisfactory. It fits nicely in my ear and stays comfortably during my office hours and exercises. And furthermore, there are no connecting line between the earbuds! (my previous bluetooth earbuds actually had one)

(2) I think I'm wearing these more than 9 hours straight. Of course for only 3 hours I actively use them to do the zoom meetings. Then around 7pm I return these back to the charging station. Then interestingly, in most of cases, it still says ""100%"". Then after a while it becomes like ""98%"". So the number can be a little misleading.",3.5 out of 5

Look : 5/5 ( looks like One plus bluetooth earphone)

1108,292.0,"First, I was mainly purchasing these headphones for the wireless and battery features. What I received was a great quality sound, and greater battery life than stated.

Pros:
- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.

- Great Design – I fell in love with headphone, from the time I set my eyes on it. It is stunning looking and great design.

- Sound Quality - The old headphones I was replacing with these were kind of tinny in sound quality. These headphones have really rich deep bass. I was extremely pleased with the sound.

Overall, it checks all boxes for a stunning Headphone at a very affordable price. I am very satisfied with my purchase.",4.2 out of 5

1110,294.0,"First of all Thank You Harman for launching an affordable headphone. Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.
If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.
Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.
The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.
The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.
I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.

Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.
Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.

1136,320.0,"Pls don't buy, i know you are going to see about all the comments positive, i am going to give the reason for that too. First of all, when you will buy the product, for the first 2 weeks it will work perfectly and you will think that the product is very good but after 2 weeks problems will start arising. One of the earbuds will stop working, after week the other earbud will also stop working. Now if you will try to claim the warranty than you will first find that they will say that they are going to reach you in 2 days but that will not happen. They will never reach to you, you will try to reach them using their customer care number but believe me they will never attend your call. Now how i am saying this i will tell you. In December 2020 i bought this product, after using it for one week i thought that it is a very good product and i suggested this product to my relative and after 2 weeks of use it stopped working and all that happened that i told you. Same happened to my relative. Its been around 1 month no one came for the replacement of the product. Now i will tell you how everyone is saying that this is a very good product. This is because almost everyone post their review under a week and all of them thought that it is a good product.

1147,331.0,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.,3.8 out of 5
1148,332.0,"I was a bit skeptical about the quality of these headphones despite the reviews as it is targeted at kids I thought most of the budget would have been spent on the appearance of the headphones.

The noise cancellation is good as my daughter can't hear me when I'm trying to talk to her when she's on her headphones; the sound is good; the battery life is really good despite the price. My daughter loves the lights on the headphones, loves the headphones as she has the choice of using bluetooth or plugging in the headphones using her headphone jack. I also found the fact you can change the max sound output great as it limits the damage to your child's hearing as they cannot turn the volume up beyond a certain point.

1149,333.0,"this headphone is giving more than you can expect at this price point.
after charging it to fully 100% it gave me music playback of 11-12hrs ( used it on different-different volume levels),
battery backup is excellent as brand mentioned.
it takes 1-1:30hrs to fully charge.
sound quality is excellent,
very clear and loud,
bass levels are great.
tried it with many different devices like laptop, pc and mobile, sounds great.
calling experience was overall good, while calling on other end person will hear little noise on your voice.
one thing i loved about it that it also supports 3.5mm jack so if it runs out of battery you can still enjoy

1154,338.0,"First, I was mainly purchasing these headphones for the wireless and battery features. What I received was a great quality sound, and greater battery life than stated.

Pros:
- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.

- Great Design – I fell in love with headphone, from the time I set my eyes on it. It is stunning looking and great design.

- Sound Quality - The old headphones I was replacing with these were kind of tinny in sound quality. These headphones have really rich deep bass. I was extremely pleased with the sound.

1156,340.0,"First of all Thank You Harman for launching an affordable headphone. Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.
If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.
Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.
The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.
The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.
I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.

Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.
Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.

PROS:
1. Nice built quality

3. The materials used are of good quality
4. Nicely toned headphones with not much bass or treble.
5. Well balanced audio
6. Good for Video/voice editing
CONS:
1. The gooseneck clip at the end makes it difficult to attach to regular tripods for your mics.
2. The built quality only suffers only in the buttons
3. Not made for people who like bass heavy headphones

1159,343.0,"Pls don't buy, i know you are going to see about all the comments positive, i am going to give the reason for that too. First of all, when you will buy the product, for the first 2 weeks it will work perfectly and you will think that the product is very good but after 2 weeks problems will start arising. One of the earbuds will stop working, after week the other earbud will also stop working. Now if you will try to claim the warranty than you will first find that they will say that they are going to reach you in 2 days but that will not happen. They will never reach to you, you will try to reach them using their customer care number but believe me they will never attend your call. Now how i am saying this i will tell you. In December 2020 i bought this product, after using it for one week i thought that it is a very good product and i suggested this product to my relative and after 2 weeks of use it stopped working and all that happened that i told you. Same happened to my relative. Its been around 1 month no one came for the replacement of the product. Now i will tell you how everyone is saying that this is a very good product. This is because almost everyone post their review under a week and all of them thought that it is a good product. I would recommend not to buy, instead collect 2 to 3 hundred rupees and go for a better company such as boat so that atleast if a problem arise they will resolve it. pls",3.5 out of 5

1200,384.0,"First, I was mainly purchasing these headphones for the wireless and battery features. What I received was a great quality sound, and greater battery life than stated.

Pros:
- Battery Life - This was one of the biggest reasons for purchasing these headphones. I was looking for a set of headphones that would last longer than 4-6 hours and stumbled across these. I run the headphones for ~6-7hrs a day for four days. On the fifth day, I run the headphones until they turn off on their own. This normally happens around noon. This gives me a battery life of about 28-32 hours, beyond the stated 25 hours.

- Great Design – I fell in love with headphone, from the time I set my eyes on it. It is stunning looking and great design.

- Sound Quality - The old headphones I was replacing with these were kind of tinny in sound quality. These headphones have really rich deep bass. I was extremely pleased with the sound.

Overall, it checks all boxes for a stunning Headphone at a very affordable price. I am very satisfied with my purchase.",4.2 out of 5

1202,386.0,"First of all Thank You Harman for launching an affordable headphone. Now talking about the sound and build quality, the sound quality is awesome if you compare it with other headphone in this price segment. The Bass, Mids and High are equally balance thus giving you a warm and soothing sound. Most Indians like bass so if you are a bass lover you should know that it won't give you over your head bass but you'll get a smooth thumping bass, you can feel the vibration in your ears without any distortion. You get a dual EQ too, normal mode and bass mode. The sound does feel different but not that much. Impressive bass tho with the right EQ settings.
If you want a very loud headphone then you won't be satisfied, I was surprised when I could still listen some songs even when both my phone and headphone volume was at 100%. I secretly wish they increase the loudness a little bit more but I'm equally satisfied.
Now about the noise cancellation considering it is in the ear headphone and not over the ear it is quite impressive.
The call quality is okay. Nothing impressive or nothing bad. The other side can hear me clearly and I too can hear the caller voice clearly.
The build quality is normal it is made entirely out of plastic. Plastic material are quite good. Doesn't look or feel fragile.
I tried putting this headphone on for 3 hours straight and I must say it is quite comfortable, you get a soft cushions and you shouldn't get any problem in 2 or 2.5 hours of wearing but at 3 or 3.5 hours you might want to rest your ears for a while.

Now at this price segment this is the best headphone available. The sound quality beats all the others headphones and yes even boAts headphones. Now about the build quality, there are other headphones better than this but hey, the sound is what important. and this headphone isn't fragile at all plus you get a one year warranty.
Well, what are you waiting for, go ahead a buy it. You won't regret afterall it is by HARMAN.

1216,400.0,Awesome sound quality. Bluetooth connection works very well. Light weight and comfortable ear cups. Bass is also quite impressive at this price point. The only problem is that the sound comes about 1 second delay while playing online games but it is fixed while using the auxillary cable provided in the box. You can pause or go to the next or previous sound track or even Youtube video and change the volume directly from the headphone. If you are buying your first headphone then this is best but i would not recommend it for people who play games all the time with headphones.,3.8 out of 5
1217,401.0,"I was a bit skeptical about the quality of these headphones despite the reviews as it is targeted at kids I thought most of the budget would have been spent on the appearance of the headphones. I was mistaken and must say that they are great. The noise cancellation is good as my daughter can't hear me when I'm trying to talk to her when she's on her headphones; the sound is good; the battery life is really good despite the price. My daughter loves the lights on the headphones, loves the headphones as she has the choice of using bluetooth or plugging in the headphones using her headphone jack. I also found the fact you can change the max sound output great as it limits the damage to your child's hearing as they cannot turn the volume up beyond a certain point.

1228,412.0,"Actually this product is myntra exclusive.The price in myntra was around 1800(including tax).

Packing :
The packing is perfect with earphones placed securely.the packing itself looks premium.

Box contents :
Boult audio earphones,a small USB cable to charge,user manual, warranty card(1year warry) and 2 pairs of extra ear tips(small and large).

First impression :

The earphones look very good and elegant.feels very light in hands.the neck band is made of some soft kind of plastic which is very comfortable to wear.the ear piece is made of metal and looks good and hard.the ear pieces can be attached together by the magnets.the magnet is good enough to hold them tight.the color of earpiece looks good and gives kinda premium look.

Buttons :

The brick on the right side has the buttons.
We get 1 multifunctional button (the middle one)which can be used to power on and power off.you can also attend the calls and end the calls by single pressing them.while playing music you can pause/play by single press.
You can adjust the volume by the the 2 buttons which is either side of the multi functional button by single pressing.long press changes the tracks when music is being played.

Connectivity :

Pairing your boult with your mobile is very easy...just press and hold the power button on the boult untill you feel the vibration twice.turn on the Bluetooth option on your mobile... search for devices and you'll find 'boult audio' just tap it and you'll be paired.also you can hear an audio that your are being connected.

Battery:

The company has not specified anything about the capacity of the battery.it states that it has 12 hours of playback.yes,the battery backup is good on this.we can easily get 12hours of play time through this earphones.

Additional features :

These earphones come with built in vibration.whenever you receive a call the earphones will start vibrating. I have to tell you,the vibration os really strong and can easily be Know even if you are in busy (like traveling in bike,or a busy street)
But remember if you're getting calls continuously it'll less the battery backup.

Sound quality :

Sound quality in these earphones are amazing.
The mids are crisp and clear, the vocals are good the bass is also heavy but it's that not punchy.but don't you can adjust the equalizer and have that punchy base.
The call quality is also good because of the condenser microphone .
These earphones have noise cancellation which works good.the volume level on these earphones are really high.i cannot go beyond 80% when I'm in office. When I'm on streets I can use full volume to make that noise isolation work.

These boult earphones are really budget friendly and has some good premium features.
If you're budget is around 1500 these are the best earphones.
there are no concerns according to me till now .
I'll update when something goes wrong.

Update !!!

So im using this product for almost 1 year and found no major issues . Except for the battery drop after 8months.

As i mentioned,it came with the vibration on calls option , but the models which they're selling now doesn't have this feature.

 Most smartwatches and smartband offer more or less of similar functionalities except for the ones where we can take calls on the watch itself. I wanted to get an Apple Watch for my wife as I was impressed by the design but fortunately I found this Noise ColorFit Pro 2 which looks very similar and premium like the Apple watch. Bought this one for Rs.2999.

📦 IN THE BOX
----------------------
፨ The smart watch module with screen protector applied
፨ 22mm wide TPU strap
፨ Charging cable
፨ Instruction Manual and Warranty Registration card

--------------------
⌚ FEATURES
--------------------
፨ 1.3 inch 240x240 capacitive display
፨ Curved glass with anti-fingerprint coating,
፨ IP68 Full dustproof and waterproof
፨ 210 mah battery - 7 to 10 days usage, 45 days standby
፨ Bluetooth 5.0 BLE
፨ 24/7 heart Rate sensor, sedentary alarm, breathe feature, and usual health and sleep monitoring.
፨ App, message, social media and call notifications.
፨ Music control
፨ Menstrual cycle tracking
፨ 9 sports mode - Walk, Yoga, Spin, Run, Climb, Workout, Bike, Hike, Treadmill.

---------------------
🗓️ MY USAGE
---------------------
፨ At just 35g weight and 22mm TPU band makes this band the very comfortable to wear. Also the strap is skin friendly and I didn’t get allergy with sweat on this band.
፨ The straps is easy to swap and replace if required and uses the spring pin type.
፨ The charging is a magnetic ping type and there is no need to remove straps or do anything. I felt this type of charging the easiest of all.
፨ The looks is very premium, though is made up of polycarbonate, the grey and black colors, the curved display on the sides and the size make it look like an Apple Watch.
፨ There are only 5 of watch faces and some of them are like the Apple watch face design. As of now the watch faces are limited and customization is limited, I hope customizations will be made available.
፨ The display is beautiful and under direct sunlight I found the watch display visible, though not the best visibility but to a certain extent.
፨ There is 1 button the side which looks like the watch crown and it acts as the function button and return button. I found it easy to navigate using the touch display and using this button.
፨ The IP68 certification means now I I don't have to worry about protection from water even more than 1m depth (IP_8) and also no need to worry about dirt (IP6_).
፨ Health, fitness and sleep tracking is very accurate in my opinion, and surprisingly the NoiseFit sport app is also good. The breathe is just to take a break and just asks us to take a deep breathe. I found using a continuous heart rate sensor get the battery under 7 days and when this feature is turned off, it takes to almost 10 days.
፨ The sleep, heart rate and health tracking are pretty accurate in my opinion. Most of the features available in smart bands and basic smart watches were available.
፨ I can now read messages and notification from the band easily. From the app I was able to turn off and on what notifications need to be shown on the watch and notifications can be enabled for vibrations.
፨ There are some quick access shortcuts from the watch like find my phone, turn off/on continuous heart rate monitoring, Do not Disturb, wrist. The female health care feature of menstrual cycle and ovulations cycle is a nice add in my opinion.

-------------------------
💖 WHAT I LIKED
-------------------------
◾ The premium design and great display. Much better than other smartwatches and bands in this category in my opinion.
◾ Battery life of 7 to 10 days.
◾ IPX68 dust and waterproof.
◾ Pretty accurate fitness, health and sleep monitoring
◾ Better control & display of calls, messages and music from the band

-------------------------------------------------
♻️ WHAT I FELT CAN BE IMPROVED

1257,27.0,What a pretty watch and bracelet 🤩🤩 it's amazing..beyond expectations..👍👍,3.9 out of 5
1258,28.0,"1) Before buying this watch I had seen some couple of reviews and videos in YouTube.When I got this it looks pretty amazing better than Pictures in Amazon and other sites.

2) Colour is matte black it can be suitable for most of the hands

3) light looks pretty and simple.",3.7 out of 5
1259,29.0,"was excited to open the package only to be let down to find out that the watch doesn't work. not sure whether to just buy new batteries or get it repaired from a local repairman. product information claims there's 1 year warranty but there's no paperwork to get that. price was cheap but had i known it would arrive in this state i wouldn't even have bothered purchasing it. amazon please mention appropriate info on the product so we understand what we're getting into. if the product was supposed to arrive without functioning please mention that too.

update: so i brought this to the repairman and was told that not only is it that it needs a new battery, it needs a full repair. im exasperated and honestly would give negative stars if i could but that's something i can only project as 1 star rating. never been so disappointed and frustrated by a product purchase on amazon. this is just jarring.",3.4 out of 5

Negative points:-
(1) don't like packing, looks very cheap..
(2) dial width is big.. brings down the look if wear on small arms.

Positive points:-
(1) look without wearing awesome.
(2) light weight as expected.
(3) built quality of belt between better and best.

It looks very good.
I gave 4 stars because, the watch came with a cheap box , and the watch had some little minute scratches under the glass.

1263,33.0,"If youwant to measure SPO2, BP, TEMP, HR, better to go for related device. Purchase separately. Within 2000 you will get all.
With the remaining money bye a wrist watch.
Atleast you will get actual result.
I planned to do so, but from reviews I started to believe! Please dont trust on accuracy of measurement. Body temp is not included. touches are good. cannot change wall paper, cannot receive call or send msg from it.

when the watch is not in my hand, kept on the bed and not in contact with me, still it is able to measure my heart beat and my spo2. It proves that it is showing random numbers. I dont know how the people gave 5 or 4 stars to this product!
I cannot return as per policy. only replacement is there.

 Most smartwatches and smartband offer more or less of similar functionalities except for the ones where we can take calls on the watch itself. I wanted to get an Apple Watch for my wife as I was impressed by the design but fortunately I found this Noise ColorFit Pro 2 which looks very similar and premium like the Apple watch. Bought this one for Rs.2999.

፨ The smart watch module with screen protector applied
፨ 22mm wide TPU strap
፨ Charging cable
፨ Instruction Manual and Warranty Registration card

--------------------
⌚ FEATURES
--------------------
፨ 1.3 inch 240x240 capacitive display
፨ Curved glass with anti-fingerprint coating,
፨ IP68 Full dustproof and waterproof
፨ 210 mah battery - 7 to 10 days usage, 45 days standby
፨ Bluetooth 5.0 BLE
፨ 24/7 heart Rate sensor, sedentary alarm, breathe feature, and usual health and sleep monitoring.
፨ App, message, social media and call notifications.
፨ Music control
፨ Menstrual cycle tracking
፨ 9 sports mode - Walk, Yoga, Spin, Run, Climb, Workout, Bike, Hike, Treadmill.

---------------------
🗓️ MY USAGE
---------------------
፨ At just 35g weight and 22mm TPU band makes this band the very comfortable to wear. Also the strap is skin friendly and I didn’t get allergy with sweat on this band.
፨ The straps is easy to swap and replace if required and uses the spring pin type.
፨ The charging is a magnetic ping type and there is no need to remove straps or do anything. I felt this type of charging the easiest of all.
፨ The looks is very premium, though is made up of polycarbonate, the grey and black colors, the curved display on the sides and the size make it look like an Apple Watch.
፨ There are only 5 of watch faces and some of them are like the Apple watch face design. As of now the watch faces are limited and customization is limited, I hope customizations will be made available.
፨ The display is beautiful and under direct sunlight I found the watch display visible, though not the best visibility but to a certain extent.
፨ There is 1 button the side which looks like the watch crown and it acts as the function button and return button. I found it easy to navigate using the touch display and using this button.
፨ The IP68 certification means now I I don't have to worry about protection from water even more than 1m depth (IP_8) and also no need to worry about dirt (IP6_).
፨ Health, fitness and sleep tracking is very accurate in my opinion, and surprisingly the NoiseFit sport app is also good. The breathe is just to take a break and just asks us to take a deep breathe. I found using a continuous heart rate sensor get the battery under 7 days and when this feature is turned off, it takes to almost 10 days.
፨ The sleep, heart rate and health tracking are pretty accurate in my opinion. Most of the features available in smart bands and basic smart watches were available.
፨ I can now read messages and notification from the band easily. From the app I was able to turn off and on what notifications need to be shown on the watch and notifications can be enabled for vibrations.
፨ There are some quick access shortcuts from the watch like find my phone, turn off/on continuous heart rate monitoring, Do not Disturb, wrist. The female health care feature of menstrual cycle and ovulations cycle is a nice add in my opinion.

💖 WHAT I LIKED

◾ Battery life of 7 to 10 days.
◾ IPX68 dust and waterproof.

◾ Better control & display of calls, messages and music from the band

The MiBand 4 is definitely feature rich and Noise ColorFit Pro 2 has similar or a bit more features, I found this one much better in areas like build, design, charging. I don't have a Honor Band so I can't compare but at this price category in my perspective this band is the best. 🥇",4 out of 5
1266,36.0,"I went for this band as I didn't want to buy Mi band 5(I already own Mi band 4). Short answer is I dont want to continue using it and there is no option to return, you can only replace which is bad.

What I like :
I love its design, its pretty stylish. I think it looks much better than Mi or honor bands. It tracks your activities automatically but its very slow to recognise the same. It has all the basic tracking activities and little more as well.

What I don't like :
Touch response is not great. Even my mi 4 has better response than this.
Very limited band face like literally around 10 or something.
The reflex world app is pretty basic.
Battery has gone down to 53% already within 3 days without bluetooth being connected to device.

Issues I faced (still facing) :
I was able to complete initial setup using app but then after that the app doesn't start, it just force closes automatically. I tried reinstalling, restarting, providing manual permissions.
I dropped an email to titan customer care and then after 2 3 hours I called them explaining my issue and then they asked me to send a video showing the issue and a ticket was created. In short its almost waste of time and experience. I have oneplus 7 and running Android 11 and they said it has nothing to do with the same.

That being said i was able to setup with using my wife phone (redmi note7 pro). 2 days have past since then and I haven't got any response from customer care.

My experience is spoilt and I have ordered Samsung fit2 and will give this to my dad or mom or wife :).",3.8 out of 5

However, it has completely stopped showing any data after 4 days and even after walking a mile wearing it, the shown step count is zero. Now it is working as a basic watch. So, be very very careful before even thinking of buying this product. And be aware of the misguiding reviews. I got this because of the misguiding reviews. Make sure those doesn't trap you.

1654,4.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5
1655,5.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1656,6.0,"base on review of expert new Nest version suppose to be faster and give more distance thats how I spend $170 to get something cost me 4 hours of running around and testing, at the end its either the same or worst.

1. distance did not improve any at all! my basement router only have bar half full even with nest still half full where is the more coverage part I hear??!@!!!

2. nest claim to be faster... yeah right I have 42 - 55 devices connected to Google wifi so yeah if you take 50 device offline sure a iphone can hit 400MB on fast dot com but so is old google wifi? in real life after all smart home product connected speed is down to 20-45mb each devices that exactly same number I used to have years ago.

3. Smart home device is complicated lately since nest \ apple \ amazon dont want to make it easy for us or just wont supported or not compatible, So your smart home product will go nuts (happen to 5-10 of my device either dead or cant be discover) after google try to take over all smart device with their nest router must use app call google home.

4. after total over 20 hours of painful conversion \ repair \merge \ new automate device at the end My speed drop cause I end up with lot of older smart home product dont work anymore and on-hub no longer supported so I lost about 5 different product gone and my internet speed drop at least 15% and tons of no response from many other smart product...specially amazon echo just disappear or not show up in alexa app.

1658,8.0,"I bought this modem with huge expectations and the modem is performing upto it. Even though I ordered a version 1 i got a version 2. Initially there was a lot of issues with the same. I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

1669,19.0,"I received this router last week which is also known as AX50. I was overexcited of getting WiFi 6 router. I overlooked some review on amazon about how it heats up when placed on flat surface and ordered myself as I needed a gigabyte router and thought to invest in the new technology. So far I can summarize some of the issues I came across on this router (I have around 10 Tp-link routers at this point, from cheapest to N to dual band.)

1. It does heat up considerably from top and bottom middle portion. If I have to keep this router and no firmware can fix this, you have to install a PC cabinet fan under it to help remove the heat.
2. This router doesn't provide Bridging/WDS functionality that all other routers that I have from tp-link has. Very disappointed as this functionality is present even in the least expensive tp-link router.
3. The range of 2.4 GHz is no better than cheapest tp-link single band dual antenna that cost around 1000 rs has so disappointed with 2.4GHz WiFi performance.
4. 5 GHz band is as usual have short range. The 5 GHz AC can connect to any device with a maximum of 1200 Mbps link speed, even if supported WiFi adapter maximum speed is higher to 1200mbps. If only AX mode is selected, router can connect to AX device to maximum of 2400 Mbps but it will not run AC mode. With mix mode with AC and AX, the maximum connection speed reduces to 1200 Mbps even for AX devices. So, this router is called AX router with 2400 Mbps for 5GHz or a AX router with 1200 Mbps that can connect to AC devices too, so it is misleading on part of TP-link. I shared the same on their forum but no response from their representative.
5. Channel numbers for each band seems to change from those set in the admin configuration page after few session so if any bridge router connected to this AX router, it will disconnect.
6. Ethernet Gigabit ports is maxing out at around 750 mbps read and 350 mbps write speed. I used CAT 7 cable to test the speed in my internal network. With a gigabit switch, I can get around 900mbps read and 600mbps write. Disappointed here too.
7. AC wifi is maxing out at 22 MBps and 45 MBps in the internal network test. This is disappointing result as this results is what I can get with older tp-link C5 router.
8. With Intel AX200NGW wifi 6 160 MHz adapter, I could connect to the router with 2400 Gbps connection.
9. This router doesn't support tp-link OneMesh functionality which allow to connect other router to form a internet mesh to avoid wifi deadspots in home or office.

For configurations, I have disabled Airtime Fairness and OFDMA. I have enabled MU-MIMO as my laptop Killer's wifi adapter 1550i supports it. Smart connect is disconnected. One ethernet and 2 wlan devices are connected to the router. AX functionality is not yet tested as I still have to install Intel's wifi 6 AX200NGW adapter to my laptop. Router is running on new firmware as mentioned in the details.

I did some test to get AX performance of the router. I enabled OFDMA, from 20 MHz till 160 MHz and MU MIMO functions for 5 GHz band and did all test with wifi router 1feet from the laptop equipped with Intel AX200NGW 160MHz wifi adapter. The test was done using Synology Diskstation connected to the router Gigabit port. Diskstation is capable of read and write of over 800 Mbps.
Channel number 120 (DFS) Below is the test results:

20MHz - Writing 98.33 Mbps reading 166.51 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 287 Mbps
40MHz - Writing 125 Mbps reading 250 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 574 Mbps
80MHz - Writing 180 Mbps reading 350 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 1200 Mbps
160MHz - Writing 165 Mbps reading 370 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 1200 Mbps
160MHz - Writing 190 Mbps reading 400 Mbps - laptop achieved connection with link speed of 2400 Mbps

Further I tested the USB 3.0 speed by connecting a Lexar Triton USB 3 with maximum speed 170 read and 170 write speed. I got no more than 15 MBps in write and 25 MBps in read when router was connected with 2400 Mbps speed. The result of these transfer is again disappointing .

Other star attraction feature of QoS and parental control won't work if you have no tp-link id and internet connection. For this id, you have to give personal information and potential risk of direct connection of this router to some Chinese company which, if they want, they can access all of your devices connected to this router.

In view of my observations since last 2 days and several test as mentioned above, I believe that this router is not worth the money spend.
Bridging/WDS function removed and AX band and USB 3 actual transfer rate as well as 2.4 GHz range are mediocre at best. Heat generation is another big issue to the longevity of the device.",4.3 out of 5

On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1671,21.0,"I had heard great reviews about the mesh systems and hence I bought the deco M4 with great expectations. While it performed well in the wifi range department it cannot work on a standalone basis - meaning you will still need to have a router installed to get the best internet connectivity.
Pros:
Wifi range is good and the transfer from one deco to another is seamless.
Cons:
Setup is complicated and needs to be installed only though an app, as it does not have a web interface
The interface for internet connections either through adsl or ppoe is buggy and offers limited options
Once the internet goes down, there is no option to reconnect and you have to wait for the deco to initiate the reconnect sequence
Similarly if the link is up but data is not working, there is no option to disconnect and reconnect. The only way to do this is to reboot which is time consuming
Wired LAN port keeps disconnecting and needs to be reconnected either through a physical disconnect or reboot
In summary:
If you want a mesh system to supplement your router this is great, but if you are thinking of using this as a standalone internet system combining the functionality of router with a wifi device and an extender - it fails spectacularly.",4.3 out of 5
1672,22.0,"I also searched too many reviews and online videos before buying this router. My old router (ISP provided) started to show problems so decided to get one. My flat (3BHK 1300 sq-ft carpet) I have placed the router not in the middle because of some issues. My net connection is 40mbps 1 to 1 which means at any time it gives exactly 40mbps speed (upload/download) without fluctuation like Jio. I have on average 7 devices connected to it including some smart devices like lights. In the box, you will get all the regular stuff like a cat cable, adapter, the router. Selected it over Asus RT-AC59U v1 (since v2 is not available) because I have found in a review article that the range of 59U is not that good.

Pros:
1. Build quality is very nice, the construction of the antenna is good but nonremovable. The product and the ports look very well put together.
2. USB2.0 port can be used to share files between multiple devices via FTP connection. Netgear Cloud is not supported in this device you can not upload from android to FTP at least for now since android is not that friendly with FTPs. You have to install a few 3rd party app for this.
3. File sharing over the internet via its USB to anywhere is possible but for this, you need to have a static IP-based internet connection which is costly.
4. Speed over 2.4Ghz is good enough, I have tested it via file sharing and it easily reaches 100-150 Mbps (1/8 in MB/s). In my flat, I have reduced the signal strength to 75% without any coverage issue.
5. Even with a low signal strength of the 5Ghz band, the good news is I play online with this coverage in my PC and never ever experienced any signal drop/connection issues. Even with 50-60% signal strength, it works flawlessly in 5Ghz. Tested with file transfer and the speed is ~350 to 450 Mbps (1/8th in MB/s) if I am using an SSD and I am sure if the signal strength is at 80-90% anyone can get 800-900mbps easily. Not a problem for me since I am using a 40mbps connection.
6. My firestick works great with only one bar of 5Ghz network and I watch HD live stream without a hitch.
7. QoS algorithm applied to the router works like a charm. If you have configured your high-priority device to use max bandwidth and specified your speed in the router QoS menu then the router manages the bandwidth in all the devices automatically so that you can have a well-balanced experience. You don't have to worry about the bandwidth your TV is using at the same time you are watching say a YouTube video on a different device.

Cons:
1. Not working with PPPoE connection of my ISP even after bios update. One reviewer also pointed out this issue and it is true. My ISP team failed to connect it via PPPoE. The solution is to bypass the PPPoE and to set an IP by your ISP in this router and they have to configure this IP with their own network mapping service. It is just like assigning an IP to your Xbox or PC so that every time you connect it via Wi-Fi it remains the same. But I want to make it clear, you don't need a static IP for this. Just a fixed local IP by your ISP will work fine. Even I am using it with a regular dynamic IP-based connection. After this trick, the router will never disappoint you.
2. Coverage for 5GHz is not good. I don't have a direct line of sight to the router (~6-meter distance) and the signal strength drops to 50-60% (-68 to -75dBm) which is not recommended.
3. Now the main issue: We use 5Ghz mainly for separating traffic and interference right? Since it is an entry-level 5GHz router, it only has four 5Ghz bands and which is bad. This info is something that you will never receive from most of the reviews. So what is the advantage of 5Ghz? You have 4 bands, your neighbor (say in a housing complex) will definitely have a dual-band router nowadays and the router might be above or below your floor and they are also using similar bands. The only solution is buying an expensive router if 5Ghz is your need to get rid of interference.

Lastly don't fall into traps like MuMiMo/Beamforming etc. Those technologies are there in the router so that its price can be increased. To know more on these techs and why it is not going to make any tangible benefit in your home network setup read some tech journals and don't follow YouTube for the answer because most YouTubers research very little and follow easily available marketing news/info to make quick videos.
Apple and a few other tech giants don't even bother to add this in their flagship laptops simply because it does not make any visible difference. Wi-Fi Range, QoS Quality, Connection stability are some important factors you should prioritize over MuMiMo and beamforming. Thanks for reading....

Update: Working fine so far, upgraded my connection to 120 Mbps (direct unshared). But the USB function I have found is not useful at all only because of limited support from the android platform. This router does not support the ReadyCloud platform of Netgear. So you cannot use the Netgear ReadyCloud android app otherwise I think I can use a Pendrive to easily transfer files across multiple platforms.",4.2 out of 5

Using it in 2 BHK ,1250 sqft apartment with 75mbps ACT broadband plan.Having 80mbps around all the corners of the house.The surface of router is extremely glossy ,will fingerprints easily.better to keep the plastic cover as given in packing.
Remove the plastic cover from bottom side of router ,it can get heated up otherwise .This router got small wall hanging slots too.If you want to use 3G dongle for internet source dlink 825 also can be opted.If you are using only broad band network cable then 841 is good enough.

Below steps can be used to configure.
It took a while to configure as there was no proper step by step guidance in manual or youtube videos.

Connect one of Lan port to laptop's network slot.Connect internet cable to WAN of router.if one looks to configure with ACT,use wired connection with laptop ,set the IP in 192.168.0.x(x can be any number below 254,.Means to use same series for laptop) then login to router 192.168.0.1 with admin/Admin combination of username and password.use wired mode of configuration from selection.

Select Ppoe/dynamic ,use ACT login,isp password ,few clicks away you can set name and password for Wifi.then finish,it might detect new firmware ,can be updated too.

Can't comment on long-term stability ,service support for the device.i had a tp-link single channel 150mbps router which I used for more than 6 years with a single complaint.Just upgrading to dual channel router of Dlink now.I felt the configuration interface was bit more easy with TP link router.",4.1 out of 5

1677,27.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best.

1681,31.0,"I bought this modem with huge expectations and the modem is performing upto it. Even though I ordered a version 1 i got a version 2. Initially there was a lot of issues with the same. I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

1685,35.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

1687,37.0,"gigabit ac1900 at the price of a ac1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5
1688,38.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1699,49.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1700,50.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5

1704,54.0,"I bought this modem with huge expectations and the modem is performing upto it. Even though I ordered a version 1 i got a version 2. Initially there was a lot of issues with the same. I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

1708,58.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

Here's a list of fixes that are there in the new firmware,

1710,60.0,"gigabit ac1900 at the price of a ac1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5

You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1723,73.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5

1727,77.0,"I bought this modem with huge expectations and the modem is performing upto it. Even though I ordered a version 1 i got a version 2. Initially there was a lot of issues with the same. I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

1731,81.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

June update-

I've replaced the Linksys router with the better performing Asus 88U router. Upgraded my intranet wiring with CAT6E for a 1Gbps intranet

September 2018 update:

1733,83.0,"gigabit ac1900 at the price of a ac1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5
1734,84.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution.

Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

1754,104.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

Here's a list of fixes that are there in the new firmware,

June update-

I've replaced the Linksys router with the better performing Asus 88U router. Upgraded my intranet wiring with CAT6E for a 1Gbps intranet

September 2018 update:

My Asus 88U has been an amazing router, I've purchased a second AC58U router for my office network with no performance hiccups. Best thing is that I can manage all my Asus routers at once with the intuitive Asus app.",4.2 out of 5

1756,106.0,"gigabit ac1900 at the price of a ac1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5
1757,107.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1769,119.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5

Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection.

Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

Here's a list of fixes that are there in the new firmware,

June update-

I've replaced the Linksys router with the better performing Asus 88U router. Upgraded my intranet wiring with CAT6E for a 1Gbps intranet

September 2018 update:

My Asus 88U has been an amazing router, I've purchased a second AC58U router for my office network with no performance hiccups. Best thing is that I can manage all my Asus routers at once with the intuitive Asus app.",4.2 out of 5
1778,128.0,"I got this router after two failed attempts with Netgear routers. It’s been over a week and I’m very happy with this routers stability and consistent performance. I will definitely recommend this v2 model. The setup process is very simple, simple design with good build quality and it has a premium touch. There are no heating issues. I got full house coverage and get the signal in second floor flat also, planning to buy one more to setup and try out AiMesh feature. I hope with a single Internet connection, I can have internet in both flats.",4.2 out of 5
1779,129.0,"gigabit ac1900 at the price of a ac1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5
1780,130.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1792,142.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5

1796,146.0,"I bought this modem with huge expectations and the modem is performing upto it. Even though I ordered a version 1 i got a version 2. Initially there was a lot of issues with the same. I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

1800,150.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5
1803,153.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1815,165.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5

1819,169.0,"I bought this modem with huge expectations and the modem is performing upto it. Even though I ordered a version 1 i got a version 2. Initially there was a lot of issues with the same. I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

However, in a nut shell the router is working fine since last five days after installation.",4.7 out of 5
1823,173.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

Here's a list of fixes that are there in the new firmware,

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1838,188.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5

1842,192.0,"I bought this modem with huge expectations and the modem is performing upto it. Even though I ordered a version 1 i got a version 2. Initially there was a lot of issues with the same. I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

However, in a nut shell the router is working fine since last five days after installation.",4.7 out of 5
1846,196.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

Here's a list of fixes that are there in the new firmware,

1848,198.0,"gigabit ac1900 at the price of a ac1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5
1849,199.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1860,210.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1861,211.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5

1865,215.0,"I bought this modem with huge expectations and the modem is performing upto it. Even though I ordered a version 1 i got a version 2. Initially there was a lot of issues with the same. I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

1869,219.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

Here's a list of fixes that are there in the new firmware,

June update-

I've replaced the Linksys router with the better performing Asus 88U router. Upgraded my intranet wiring with CAT6E for a 1Gbps intranet

1871,221.0,"gigabit ac1900 at the price of a ac1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5

Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1884,234.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5

1888,238.0,"I bought this modem with huge expectations and the modem is performing upto it. Even though I ordered a version 1 i got a version 2. Initially there was a lot of issues with the same. I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

1892,242.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

June update-

I've replaced the Linksys router with the better performing Asus 88U router. Upgraded my intranet wiring with CAT6E for a 1Gbps intranet

September 2018 update:

1894,244.0,"gigabit ac1900 at the price of a ac1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5
1895,245.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.

The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router.

The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

1915,265.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

Here's a list of fixes that are there in the new firmware,

June update-

I've replaced the Linksys router with the better performing Asus 88U router. Upgraded my intranet wiring with CAT6E for a 1Gbps intranet

September 2018 update:

My Asus 88U has been an amazing router, I've purchased a second AC58U router for my office network with no performance hiccups. Best thing is that I can manage all my Asus routers at once with the intuitive Asus app.",4.2 out of 5

1917,267.0,"gigabit ac1900 at the price of a ac1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5
1918,268.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1930,280.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5

I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

June update-

I've replaced the Linksys router with the better performing Asus 88U router. Upgraded my intranet wiring with CAT6E for a 1Gbps intranet

September 2018 update:

My Asus 88U has been an amazing router, I've purchased a second AC58U router for my office network with no performance hiccups. Best thing is that I can manage all my Asus routers at once with the intuitive Asus app.",4.2 out of 5
1939,289.0,"I got this router after two failed attempts with Netgear routers. It’s been over a week and I’m very happy with this routers stability and consistent performance. I will definitely recommend this v2 model. The setup process is very simple, simple design with good build quality and it has a premium touch. There are no heating issues. I got full house coverage and get the signal in second floor flat also, planning to buy one more to setup and try out AiMesh feature. I hope with a single Internet connection, I can have internet in both flats.",4.2 out of 5
1940,290.0,"gigabit ac1900 at the price of a ac1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5
1941,291.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1953,303.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5

1957,307.0,"I bought this modem with huge expectations and the modem is performing upto it. Even though I ordered a version 1 i got a version 2. Initially there was a lot of issues with the same. I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

1961,311.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5
1964,314.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

1976,326.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5

1980,330.0,"I bought this modem with huge expectations and the modem is performing upto it. Even though I ordered a version 1 i got a version 2. Initially there was a lot of issues with the same. I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

However, in a nut shell the router is working fine since last five days after installation.",4.7 out of 5
1984,334.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

Here's a list of fixes that are there in the new firmware,

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

1987,337.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band.

1999,349.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5

2003,353.0,"I bought this modem with huge expectations and the modem is performing upto it. Even though I ordered a version 1 i got a version 2. Initially there was a lot of issues with the same. I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

2007,357.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

Here's a list of fixes that are there in the new firmware,

2009,359.0,"gigabit ac1900 at the price of a ac1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5

For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

2021,371.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

2022,372.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5

2026,376.0,"I bought this modem with huge expectations and the modem is performing upto it. Even though I ordered a version 1 i got a version 2. Initially there was a lot of issues with the same. I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

2030,380.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

2032,382.0,"gigabit ac1900 at the price of a ac1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5

Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

2045,395.0,"Upgraded to the TP-Link C20 after doing a fair amount of research. The problem we were facing with a conventional single band router was that despite having a 5 Mbps unlimited Internet connection, it was difficult to share the bandwidth if one user was streaming HD video. Practically, Internet use on other devices was coming to a grinding halt. We have a large number of devices connected to the router: a PS4, a Firestick and 2 laptops besides 4 mobiles connected to the router. It is important to understand the difference between 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals. 5GHz handles high speed video streaming very well but has shorter range. 2.4 GHz has better range but is not as fast besides being a congested frequency. Note, not all laptops and mobiles support 5 GHz frequency. Once your C20 is set up, it will show as 2 separate networks, one for each frequency. For best results you should connect the video streaming devices like Smart TV, PS4 and Firestick on 5 GHz and other devices incl. mobiles, laptops and tablets on 2.4 GHz. This configuration will allow efficient sharing of bandwidth. Please note for this to work well, you HD streaming devices (5 GHz connected) should not be too far from the C20 router. The initial setup took a bit of time but once it was done it has been smooth. Just like other routers, an occasional restart keeps it running best. Very good build quality and great value as usual from TP-Link. Hope this helps!",4.3 out of 5

Also, it is difficult to get speed when you are in another room of a 1400sq ft flat ones the device is placed in the center of the house. The speed is really good when you are in close proximity of the device like around 5-6 meters or without any hindrance.",3.3 out of 5
2049,399.0,"I bought this modem with huge expectations and the modem is performing upto it. Even though I ordered a version 1 i got a version 2. Initially there was a lot of issues with the same. I'm writing this review to help those who are having trouble with this modem. I am a BSNL broadband user.
Modem configuration is simple and hassle free. Only thing u need to enter is your BSNL username and password rest is automatically done by the modem as u select your country (India) and service provider (BSNL). The modem started working smoothly and I was so happy with the range. It could cover my entire home.

But sooner or later modem started showing the same issue repeatedly. WiFi gets turned off automatically and the internet connection also gets disconnected. The only light that turns on in the modem will be DSL and power. Rest of the lights get turned off automatically. The only solution for this problem is to reset and reconfigure your modem every now and then, which is a great pain in the arse. Initially since I thought the issue was with my BSNL exchange r connection I spent more than a week disturbing them. Well they couldn't find anything wrong with my connection. It was too late when I realized that the modem is faulty.(return window just got closed a day before the realization).

So I googled and even went through FAQs n here and some of the reviews. And I got this idea of calling the dlink customer service. The associate from the other side asked for a few details and she told me to update the firmware which she's going to mail me. So soon after the call got disconnected I updated the firmware of my modem to 1.7 which was 1.5 when I got t. To my surprise my problem got resolved thereafter. Now everything works like a charm. I'm writing this after 15 days of usage. So instead of yelling at cloudtail or Amazon do what I did and enjoy surfing. Hope this helps at least some of you. Because if there's a review like this it could have saved a lot of time for me. Happy surfing...

However, in a nut shell the router is working fine since last five days after installation.",4.7 out of 5
2053,403.0,"To the point, I try to buy only smart routers.

I'm currently using a Linksys EA6500 AC1750 (₹14000) smart Dual band gigabit Router as a primary modem router for my ACT Fibernet connection. Then I had cat 6 cables run around the house. Other end needed a good gigabit router with a good enough range. I was using a Netgear R6220 AC1200 smart gigabit router (₹3400) which was okay buy not all that good.

With Netgear & D-Link (threw away all my D-Link products) , I had issues especially with unstable WIFI connection. And what really lacked was control on these other routers (all similarly priced) they just seemed restricted and dumbed down.

Then I stumbled on to this Asus RT-AC58U. It had all the requirements I wanted, like WRT, print server & of course VPN.

PROS:
-Decent build quality
-Very good performance (consistent data speeds)
-MU-MIMO support (very stable wireless connection)
-Good 2.4Ghz Range & 5GHz Coverage
-Wave-2 802.11ac support
-USB 3.0 with Print server, 4g dongle support & file server
-VPN client & server support. (Darn important)

CONS:
-Only one USB port ( too bad that it's only one)
-Changes in settings will take time and restart the router (super slow reboot)
-No AiMesh feature (will buy the RT-AC86U soon)

Only after Linksys's most beautiful interface, The Asus WRT GUI is also a delight to work with, and it's just like my ASUS prime b250 motherboard's UEFI seen on them, the layout, the feel, its top notch.

Coming to VPN, it supports both VPN client & Server setup with PPTP, L2TP & OpenVPN Support. I personally have a CyberGhost Premium subscription & had no problem setting up an OpenVPN client in this router. After setup, activate and u can forget about it, as the VPN automatically reconnects after a restart. With VPN, the connection speeds usually drop a lot but luckily ain't my problem, I experienced stable & decent data speeds with pings less than <50ms which was truly impressive. I even tried with my other paid VPN subscriptions like Keepsolid's VPN Unlimited, ivacy Premium & Tiger VPN.

Out of these, CyberGhost VPN was the only better performing client & it's very safe , doesn't keep logs, has malware protection & ad blocker feature and it's out of the 5 eyes, 9 eyes & 14 eyes countries list.

For the asking price of ₹4300, the ASUS RT-AC58U Wi-Fi Router offers a great deal. It's the perfect stepping stone between budget and powerhouse, just keep in mind this is a router only, and won't perform any miracle to a weaker Internet connection.

Typical impressive ASUS performance, sleek visuals and pleasant UI. Stable connection & transfer speeds.

One useful tip for you is to immediately update the firmware to Version 3.0.0.4.380.8228 that's released on April 2018. Will fix the problems what others mentioned in their negative feedbacks.

June update-

I've replaced the Linksys router with the better performing Asus 88U router. Upgraded my intranet wiring with CAT6E for a 1Gbps intranet

September 2018 update:

2055,405.0,"gigabit ac1900 at the price of a ac1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

Didnt see many reviews out there, so writing my personal experience after usage of 2 days.

Wanted a replacement for my existing 150mbps router. Was perfectly happy with it, but had used it for over 11 years now. Secondly with work from home setting, I was facing frame drops in skype / zoom meetings.

What I run on wifi is 2 smart tv's includes 1 fire stick, 6 smartphones and 2 laptops. All worked flawlessly except for video calls on the laptop. No gaming anywhere.

I have a 50 mbps guaranteed line. On testing, I get 49 to 80 mbps download and the same for uploads. My need was a gigabit router seeing that jio was launching 100 mbps + broadband connections. So cheaper ac1200 ones were out. Though I had shortlisted dlink 1200 model @ 1250 rs. It was not gigabit, but at that price was a steal. The other cheaper option was 2000 rs Mercusys gigabit model.

Thinking the lockdown will end, dragged my feet in purchasing a new router as the current one had no real complaints. Then this model was launched @ 3300 rs. It was the right upgrade for futureproofing the purchase. I remembered paying 200 bucks more to purchase a n router. It served me well for 11 years.

Even after carting it, i dilly dallied till the price dropped to 2800. Purchased it.

Delivered in 1 day. Sanitised and installed immediately. Salient points

A) fairly small sized with oversized antennae. Looks like a giant spider invaded your room.

B) easy install. My network was mac locked. Entered the mac address of my earlier router. Worked like a charm. Called the operator and asked him to re-register with the new machine id. 2 minutes and done.

C) 2 gigabit ports. Checked with 2 laptops. They are geniune gigabit ports. Covered them with insulation tape to avoid dust to get in.

D) It is not wall mountable. No nail hooks. Currently hanging with the ethernet wan cable hooked to a nail. When lockdown ends, will install onto a wall stand.

E) it has smart networking. One ssid with 2 different bands combined. The target device seamlessly switches between the stronger signal. No more manual selection.

F) one of my laptop is not a dual band reciever. So I have to run the 2.4ghz network. At the start i had enabled only the 5ghz network and then dual with smart networking. Laptop didnt pick up the signal. Then i disabled the smart network. Laptop picked up the 2.4gh network. Registered, connected and then switched on the smart network. Works flawlessly now and connects immediately.

G) laptop connects at 150 mbps - n network, 40 mhz band. Phones connect at 433 mbps. Havent seen 600 mbps nor 1200 mbps ac connection yet on any device. If there is a way to check, please do inform. Till that time, i take the company's word for it.

H) Network strength is good with 5ghz network dropping to 2.4ghz at the corner of the house automatically and seamlessly. I use the signal power at its lowest strength. Signal easily covers the flat of 2200 sq feet easily. At full signal strength 5 ghz distance increases by one additional wall. 2.4 ghz is strong throughout and reaches all corners at lowest power setting. Router is at one corner of the flat and not at the centre as it ideally should be.

I) there is no app. Browser control is the only way to control.

J) its switched on for over 38 hours now. Slightly warm but no drops yet. All devices running smoothly. My earlier router was always on but it never got warm. This one is slightly warm to touch. Maybe after i remove the plastic, it may help. But it is only warm, not hot.

K) no telltale lights. Just one very light led. Dosnt say much or indicate anything except that its on and connected. Till its connected, it flashes red then it has been green throughout.

L) if you want to change the channel and its width, you have to disable the smart function and then choose the wireless option. After that, then enable the smart function. Thats it.

Package has the router, charger 12volt 1 amp and an ethernet cable. Good packaging.

Summarising - gigabit ac1900 at the price of a 1200 if you dont need 4 lan ports, string of indicative lights nor a usb port for dongles.

I will update if i find any issues or have any important feature to update.

Feel free to contact for any clarification or additional details.

Edit - So far so good. Net line upgraded to 100 mbps guaranteed. This unit handles it like a charm. Updated the firmware. This unit dosnt have any custom firmware yet. Waiting for one.

Set up a server to test its efficiency. Worked as a charm.

If you are using a firestick and the connection drops frequently, change the dhcp pool in settings from xxx. 100 to xxx.105 onwards. Dont know why it happens, but the solution was given to me from a trusted source. Works like a charm. Cheers.

Edit - had updated the firmware. I dont know what happened but the firestick kept dropping the line time and again. I rolled back the uodate, and it works like a charm. No problems faced. In all the time of ownership, router has been switched off 4 times and rebooted about 6 times.",4 out of 5
2056,406.0,"I am writing this review on the item that I already got replaced thinking the previous one was faulty. Today when I received the replaced one I understand that the earlier product was not faulty rather the product line itself is poor.
Let me explain - It has dual band and the 2.4 ghz band should be used either for clients that don;t support 5ghz band or the client is too far that 5 ghz does not have enough signal strength. For a flat spanning 30 ft, if the router is kept in one of the edge rooms, it is evident that from the room on the other end it is difficult to get 5ghz, so need to fallback to 2.4 ghz band. The router does auto switching based on signal strength if Smart switching is enabled. Now the problem is the 2.4 ghz band has some serious issue handling data volume. I just copied a video file from my desktop (wired connection) to my laptop on 2.4 band, and within a minute it stopped transmission, ping go so high that Request timeout started coming, and the situation never gets better unless I pause the copy. The speed was merely below 2 MBps, meaning ~16 mbps whereas it claims 300 mbps. 16 mbps is not the problem, I can live with that but the problem is under this load it stops functioning at all. This situation only happens with 2.4 ghz radio. It looks like it is not able to handle any load beyond 5 mbps. The same issue happens whenever I play any youtube video on 2k or 4k resolution. It starts with ~10 mbps, but very soon it drops to 400 kbps. You can understand that such unstable connection is of no use especially where my 4k tv can't get the 5ghz in range and has to rely on the 2.4 ghz. On the contrary when I ran the same test with my old dlink 605L router (only 2.4 ghz band) it could consistently give ~25-30 mbps without a single ping loss. Both the router are placed very close so I won't say that the dlink gets location advantage here.
It looks like this router fails to deliver basic functionality in pursuit to provide advanced features like band switching MU-MIMO etc. The radio is not faulty because I get ~-40-50 db strength on the radio. It seems the firmware is not optimized and the processor is of low grade that can't send the data in a sustained manner.
I bought it to upgrade from my old router to new so that data handling and transmission rates improved but I end up using two router with total of 6 antennas with messy wires everywhere.
I don't want to keep the router because it is not solving my problem, but Amazon is not allowing me to raise a refund request. So its a earnest request to Amazon to kindly refund me so that I can bought another dlink router and run it as a range extender to resolve my problem.
Another warning to the buyers - its boot time is ~3-4 minutes that is huge as compared to my dlink router (< 15 secs). So make sure to use a ups otherwise frequent power cut would be pain is the ***.
Another caution about TPlink call center in India - I called them explaining the fact they said to manually allocate the router on Ch-11. And said ""WAIT FOR SOME TIME IT WILL IMPROVE"". As if it has got some machine learning or AI enabled.
I hope buyers get a good idea about this product. Again as long as you are on 5 ghz you are happy. Don't let any device to use 2.4 radio then you are frustrated for life.

The phone lags sometimes. Because it has 3gb of ram and MIUI is heavy. I will suggest the 4gb version. The CPU is powerful enough for daily tasks. It gives a premium experience. (Better then redmi) It doesn't have any ads.,5
